/**
 * The landing CTA is commercial state, not static content.
 *
 * Vercel can qualify a Production build in an environment where the build-time commercial flags
 * are intentionally scrubbed while the deployed runtime is live. If this route is prerendered,
 * that safe build-time "pilot" result gets frozen into the HTML and a live self-service site can
 * keep saying "Request access" even while /api/status correctly reports selfService=true.
 *
 * Resolve the state on each request instead. The page itself is light, the deployed function is in
 * the same region as the rest of the app, and this avoids a wrong CTA or a hydration-time label
 * swap on the most important conversion surface.
