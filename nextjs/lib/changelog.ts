/*
  The changelog as data.

  Masterplan 13.3 says what was wrong with the prose version: two entries, both about website
  work, written from the inside. "Changed the landing page to five scenes" is a record of what we
  did; a changelog is a record of what someone else can now do, or must now change.

  So an entry is grouped the way a reader triages one -- Added, Improved, Fixed -- and carries
  the three fields that decide whether they have to act: which surface it touched, whether it
  breaks a published contract, and what to do about it if it does. Everything the page renders
  comes from here, including the feed, so a release cannot appear on one and not the other.

  What is deliberately absent: entries for anything not in this repository. A changelog is the
  one page where a plausible-sounding line is indistinguishable from a true one, and there is no
  receipt behind it to check.

    added: [
      "The MCP server exposes eight read-only tools: list_sources, get_world, search_world, ask_world, get_object, get_relation, get_evidence and download_package.",
      "A Compiled World Package validator checks what is inside an export: that relations resolve, that every region sits inside its page, that the Turtle, JSON-LD and CSV describe the same graph, and that the package's own report counts what the package holds.",
      "Documentation covering the endpoint reference, the error catalogue, run events and the package format, with each request in cURL, Python and TypeScript.",
      "Compiling more sources than one compile can hold: a run of up to 128 documents is split into parts and followed as one run. Each part compiles to its own World, and the parts are not merged — matching an object in one part to an object in another is identity resolution that is not built.",

    improved: [
      "Every public page declares its own canonical, description and share card instead of inheriting the homepage's.",
      "Preflight reads the real page count from the document where the format states one, and says so, rather than estimating from file size.",
      "Archive expansion runs off the main thread, so a large ZIP no longer freezes the tab that is unpacking it.",
    ],
    fixed: [
      "Three connector adapters threw on a null row from a provider instead of skipping it.",
      "A compile started in one tab is picked up again when the tab is reopened, rather than being abandoned with the reading already paid for.",
    ],
    breaking: "The MCP tool names changed. list_documents, get_collection, get_active_world and ask_active_world are now list_sources, get_world and ask_world.",
    migration: "Update the tool names your agent calls, then re-register the server. Pin the release you registered: node tavonel-mcp.mjs --version prints it, and the sha256 of every asset is in the distribution channel.",
